Hello! My name is Ravi (*ruh-vee*). I'm currently working as a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India, and I'm part of the ReFoRM (Reimagining Foundation Retrieval Models) team. I tackle problems relating to retrieval, extreme classification, and language models. I work with Dr. Gaurav Sinha and Prof. Manik Varma, and I've been very lucky to have helped create and lead the Extreme Vocabulary project.

Prior to joining MSR, I studied at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, where I graduated with a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. I worked on Visual Question Answering and Visual Commonsense Reasoning with Prof. Chandra Sekhar, and I still have an active interest in this line of work.

Please feel free to shoot me an email!
